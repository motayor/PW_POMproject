In POM, we create page class for every page that we shall visit and do action on.
Although, the Page locator will automaticvally look for an elemnet on the current page,
it is a good practice to create a class for each page so that when the project get complex, we
can easily make local changes without breaking things in other places.

Also, the methods in each page can be called in other pages for more efficient object modelling.

TIPS
1. Do not use assertions in your page classes
2. Do not use PW functions(such as .fill, .click, etc.) in your Test classes
